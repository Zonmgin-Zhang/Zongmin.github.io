I'm Zongmin Zhang, an MSc student in Computer Science at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), and my academic journey began with a BSc in Computer Science with a focus on Database Systems from [The University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/homepage/). My research interest is Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its related fields.

Currently, I'm serving as a Vision Algorithm Intern at the Hong Kong Institute of Science & Innovation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I'm focused on developing large medical language models and an external medical knowledge base. Previously, I was a System Development Intern at Meituan, where I honed my skills in Java SpringBoot and backend development.

In academia, I've worked under [Prof. Antoni B. Chan](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~abchan/) at City University as a Research Assistant on a Plagiarism Detection System project, improving accuracy and contributing to both the system's backend and frontend. I'm also participating in a Financial Machine Translation project under [Dr. Linqi Song](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/songlinqi.htm), refining models' performance and developing decoding strategies for machine translation applications in finance.
